# Skill trees: ONE canonical source, one generated mirror (DRY).
#
# `.claude/skills/` is the CANONICAL, human-edited skill tree (Claude Code reads it directly).
# `.agents/skills/` is a GENERATED MIRROR for non-Claude agent tooling (e.g. Codex, which has no native
# "skills" mechanism but can be pointed at plain markdown runbooks from AGENTS.md) — never hand-edit it.
# This script regenerates the mirror; `--check` verifies they are in sync.
#
# Why a copy and not a symlink: a checkout without core.symlinks=true (common on Windows) materializes
# git symlinks as text files, which would break Codex's reads. A generated copy + a drift check is portable.
#
# Both `.claude/*` and `.agents/*` are currently git-ignored in this repo — the skill content is being kept
# local until a public/private decision is made, but the two trees still need to agree with each other for
# whichever agent happens to read the mirror.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sync-skills.sh            # regenerate .agents/skills from .claude/skills
#   scripts/sync-skills.sh --check    # exit non-zero if the mirror is stale
